## Build

Clone this repository first. Then,

```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Quick Start

```shell script
$ cd build
$ ./poker.out
```

## Note

Everyone comes into the game with the same stack.
There is no side pot.

And there is no chop.
If more than one player wins, one of them wins.
We do not consider fractions of the pot.
